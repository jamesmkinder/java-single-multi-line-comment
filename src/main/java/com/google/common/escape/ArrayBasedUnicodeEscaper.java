         This is a bit of a hack but lets us do quicker per-character checks in
         the fast path code. The safe min/max values are very unlikely to extend
         into the range of surrogate characters, but if they do we must not test
         any values in that range. To see why, consider the case where:
         safeMin <= {hi,lo} <= safeMax
         where {hi,lo} are characters forming a surrogate pair such that:
         codePointOf(hi, lo) > safeMax
         which would result in the surrogate pair being (wrongly) considered safe.
         If we clip the safe range used during the per-character tests so it is
         below the values of characters in surrogate pairs, this cannot occur.
         This approach does mean that we break out of the fast path code in cases
         where we don't strictly need to, but this situation will almost never
         occur in practice.
